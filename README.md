# orpheus

orpheus is an introspective, interactive web program.

a mix of digital art animation, creative writing, and web coding, orpheus hopes to invoke self-reflection through an inward-looking narrative. take a journey and learn something about yourself!

pause in between pages. write down your thoughts. this is meant to provoke introspection and stimulate mindfulness.

unfortunately, orpheus's sound does not work on mobile. to get the full experience, please use full screen on desktop and allow autoplay on your browser for this site to enable the background music.

this was mainly done in html, css, and procreate.
